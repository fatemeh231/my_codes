## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of professional tennis data, developed as part of a data analysis assignment. Using Python and data visualization tools, we explored player performance, match dynamics, and broader trends in the sport. Our goal was to answer 17 key analytical questions that reveal insights into player statistics, match characteristics, and gender-based comparisons.

## 📊 Key Questions Explored

1. **How many tennis players are included in the dataset?**  
2. **What is the average height of the players?**  
3. **Which player has the highest number of wins?**  
4. **What is the longest match recorded in terms of duration?**  
5. **How many sets are typically played in a tennis match?**  
6. **Which country has produced the most successful tennis players?**  
7. **What is the average number of aces per match?**  
8. **Is there a difference in the number of double faults based on gender?**  
9. **Which player has won the most tournaments in a single month?**  
10. **Is there a correlation between a player's height and their ranking?**  
11. **What is the average duration of matches?**  
12. **What is the average number of games per set in men's vs. women's matches?**  
13. **What is the distribution of left-handed vs. right-handed players?**  
14. **What is the most common surface type used in tournaments?**  
15. **How many distinct countries are represented in the dataset?**  
16. **Which player has the highest win percentage against top 10 opponents?**
